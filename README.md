# <u>**BB-PRED**: Machine learning based drug permeablity prediction across Blood-Brain barrier in CNS.</u>

## What is **blood brain barrier**?
<br>
The bloodâ€“brain barrier (BBB) is a highly selective semipermeable border of endothelial cells that prevents solutes in the circulating blood from non-selectively crossing into the extracellular fluid of the central nervous system where neurons reside.

## What obstacles faced during **drug discovery**?
<br>
Drug design and discovery is a very expensive process, with numerous new compounds being developed at a rapid rate. Only around<span style="color:red"> 2%</span> of known drugs can pass through the BBB, this presents a problem in the Central Nervous System (CNS) drug development.
<br>
<br>

## **<U>AIM OF THE PROJECT:</U>**
This project aims to develop a solution that can predict, with confidence, the probability of a drug passing through the BBB in the hope that this can speed up the process of developing a CNS drug.
